============

ManetBuilder is designed to aid wireless network systems engineers and telecommunications researchers in creating wireless topologies with mobility.  You'll find many features in this program that help users to quickly see the relationships between wireless nodes such as displaying  signal ranges, communication links, distances, mobility paths, and  application connections.  As of version 0.3, there is no support for adding wired networks. ManetBuilder is written in Java.
